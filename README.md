# Robust Artificial Intelligence Test Event (RAITE) Data Collection

Welcome to the RAITE Data Collection Repository! This repository contains templates for the upcoming event.

## Event Overview

The event involves three different types of teams: 
**Blue Teams** should operate real-time vision-based tracking algorithm to identify, detect, and track humans in video scenes;
**Red Team** should generate attacks on *Blue Team's* human detection/tracking algorithms using physical or digital methods; and 
**Purple Team** should analyze 10-minute video data with ground truth and evaluates human detection/tracking algorithms offline.

We encourage teams to document their processes by opening issues in this repository.

## Getting Started

To provide information about your team's setup, components, and ML pipeline steps, you'll find dedicated issue templates under the [Issues](https://github.com/nd-crane/raite-data-collection/issues) section, and from there, you can follow the steps:

- Click on the `New Issue` button in the upper right of the screen. Each **Read** and **Blue** team will have its own issue template.
- Select the appropriate issue template for your team. Each template contains detailed instructions and examples to guide you through the process.
- Complete the information as accurately as possible and `submit the new issue`.

**Note:** It is not mandatory to provide details for every field in the issue.
