# Data to be collected during the 2023 RAITE event   

## Demographical Data
Red Teams will generate physical or digital attacks on Blue Team system vision-based human detection/tracking algorithms.
Physical atacks will be executed by actors that should follow scripts proposed by Red Teams.

The following columns should be a starting point for capturing demographical data from actors involved in physical attacks on the Blue Team system's vision-based human detection/tracking algorithms. 

1. **Session ID**: A unique identifier for each participant's session. This could be generated by the researcher and follows the format YYYY-DDD-SSS.

2. **First Name**: The participant's first name.

3. **Last Name**: The participant's last name.

4. **Email**: The ND email address of the participant.

5. **Participated Before**: Whether the participant has participated in prior data collection experiments at CVRL, with responses "Yes," "No," or "Not sure."

6. **Gender**: The gender of the participant, with options like "Female," "Male," "Non-binary," and "I prefer not to specify."

7. **Race**: The participant's race, with options like "White," "Black or African American," and space to specify other races.

8. **Birth Year**: The year of birth of the participant (between 1958 and 2005).

9. **Height**: The approximate height of the participant, specified in either feet and inches or centimeters.

10. **Weight**: The approximate weight of the participant, specified in either pounds or kilograms.

11. **Hair Color:** Actor's hair color.

12. **Eye Color:** Actor's eye color.

13. **Demographic Notes:** Any additional demographic information or notes about the actor.


#### Important Notice: Confidentiality of Demographic Information

It is crucial to highlight that the demographic information collected in this spreadsheet is sensitive and private in nature. This data should under no circumstances be made publicly available or shared without proper authorization.

## Experiment Data

Each experiment session will be assigned to one Blue and one Red Team, and may involve multiple cameras, actors, and models. One video per camera will be produced from each session.

### Video Metadata

Video streams must be saved using lossless compression techniques to ensure the highest quality.

Video names must adhere to a specific format, incorporating the following elements: date and time (including seconds), actor IDs (if applicable), blue team ID, red team ID, and camera ID. Besides, each video should begin with a unique ID.
Here is an example of a video name following the specified format:

`00001_2023-09-13_14-30-45_Actor123_BlueTeam1_RedTeam2_CameraA.mpeg`

### Subjects
[TODO]

### Experiments

We would like to systematically document and track attacks from REad teams for each experiment session, including their specifics, impact, timestamps, and related documentation or code. This information can be valuable for pots analysis and research.

Suggestions for metadata to be captured:

1. **Video ID**: A unique identifier for the video associated with the attack experiment.

2. **Blue Team ID**: An identifier for the blue team involved in the experiment.

3. **Red Team ID**: An identifier for the red team involved in the experiment.

4. **Attack Type**: The type or category of the physical attack. You can customize this based on your specific attack tactics.

5. **Attack Description**: A brief description or summary of the specific attack tactic used.

6. **Attack Date and Time**: The date and time when the physical attack occurred. This column allows you to capture both the date and time of the attack.

7. **Severity Level**: The severity or impact level of the attack, categorized as "Low," "Medium," or "High" based on its potential impact on the blue team's performance.

8. **Incident Documentation Link**: If you have detailed incident documentation or reports related to the physical attack (e.g., videos, images, logs), you can provide a link to access that documentation.

9. **Script Link**: If there are scripts or code related to the physical attack, stored in a GitHub repository or elsewhere, you can provide a link to access those scripts. This can be useful for referencing the code used in the attack.
