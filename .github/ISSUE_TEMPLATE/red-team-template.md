#### Physical Attack Strategy:

- Description: [Briefly describe your physical attack strategy, goals, and objectives.]

Example:
- Description: Our physical attack strategy focuses on exploiting the limitations of the recognition system by wearing patterned shirts that effectively make a person invisible to the system's detection.

#### Procedures to Implement Physical Attack:

- Steps: [Provide a step-by-step breakdown of the procedures you'll follow to implement the physical attack.]

Example:
- Steps:
  1. Research and identify the recognition system's algorithms and weaknesses.
  2. Design and create patterned shirts with intricate designs to disrupt the system's ability to detect people.
  3. Wear the patterned shirts during test scenarios near the recognition system.
  4. Document and analyze the system's performance in the presence of the patterned shirts.

#### Costs and Time Investments:

- Money Spent: [Approximately how much money was spent on materials, tools, or resources to create your physical attack capability.]

Example:
- Money Spent: $100 for fabric, printing, and shirt creation.

- Time Spent: [Approximately how much time was spent creating your physical attack capability, in hours or days.]

Example:
- Time Spent: 15 hours over the span of 3 days.

#### Additional Information:

- [Provide any other relevant information, notes, or resources related to your physical attack strategy and implementation.]

Example:
- We conducted preliminary tests with different patterns and colors to optimize the invisibility effect.
- The attack strategy leverages the limitations of the recognition system's visual processing.

#### Questions:

- [List any questions or clarifications you need from the organizers or the Blue Team regarding your physical attack strategy and implementation.]

Example:
- Are there any specific environmental conditions or lighting situations that we should consider during our physical attack tests?
