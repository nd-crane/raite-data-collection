#### Attack Strategy:

- Description: [Briefly describe your attack strategy, goals, and objectives.]

Example:
- Description: Our attack strategy aims to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the Blue Team's image classification model's input preprocessing pipeline to inject adversarial examples.

#### Procedures to Implement Attack:

- Steps: [Provide a step-by-step breakdown of the procedures you'll follow to implement the attack.]

Example:
- Steps:
  1. Identify potential weak points in the model's input pipeline.
  2. Generate adversarial examples using techniques like FGSM.
  3. Inject these adversarial examples into the testing data.
  4. Monitor model performance and behavior.

#### Costs and Time Investments:

- Money Spent: [Approximately how much money was spent on tools, resources, or services to create your attack capability.]

Example:
- Money Spent: $500 for GPU cloud resources and adversarial attack libraries.

- Time Spent: [Approximately how much time was spent creating your attack capability, in hours or days.]

Example:
- Time Spent: 20 hours over the span of 5 days.

#### Additional Information:

- [Provide any other relevant information, notes, or resources related to your attack strategy and implementation.]

Example:
- We leveraged existing adversarial attack libraries to expedite our testing process.
- Our attack strategy is focused on injecting perturbations into the image data to evade the model's classification.
- Code and attack procedures can be found in our GitHub repository: [link to repository].

#### Questions:

- [List any questions or clarifications you need from the organizers or the Blue Team regarding your attack strategy and implementation.]

Example:
- Have there been any updates or defenses implemented to the model's input preprocessing since the event started?
- Are there any constraints or specific aspects of the model we should be aware of before executing our attack?

#### Deadline:

- [Insert deadline for the completion of this attack information gathering task.]
